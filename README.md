# How-to-Code-Systematic-Program-Design

# Part 1
This short series of programming courses are unique in focusing on learning a systematic programming method rather than a programming language. This practical approach will help you channel your creativity so that you can program well in any language.

SPD1 presents the core design method with a focus on simple data. You will learn techniques that help you develop your program requirements; how to produce programs with consistent structure that are easy to modify later; and how to make your programs more reliable by building tests as an integral part of the programming process. This part concludes with the design of simple interactive program. The final project is an interactive game.

This course is part of the How to Code - Systematic Program Design XSeries Program:

What you'll learn
How to represent information as data
How to focus each part of your program on a single task
How to use examples to clarify what your program should do
How to determine the proper tests for a program
How to simplify the structure of your program using common patterns


# Part 2
- Building on the core method from SPD1, this course quickly expands to cover more complex programs. You will design animations and games in which a number of objects move around the screen. You will also design programs that operate on family trees and other hierarchical structures.

But even as your programs get more complex, you will find that the design method makes them easy to write; and that the resulting code is well-structured, well-tested and easy to maintain.

What you'll learn
How to identify information with inherently linear structure.
How to identify information with inherently hierarchical structure.
How to represent linear and hierarchical information as data.
Designing functions to operate on such data.

# Part 3 
of the How to Code â€“ Systematic Program Design series, you will design programs that even experienced developers would find challenging. The design method you have been learning since How To Code - Systematic Program Design Part 1 will really deliver here, because you will be able to crank out these programs with relative ease.

By learning how to capture common data and control structures using abstraction, your programs will get shorter and better tested.

In this part of the course we will learn how to design search programs. You will design a program to solve Sudoku puzzles, and will be able to design many other puzzle solvers as well.
